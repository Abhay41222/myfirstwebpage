 <h2>Introduction To C++</h2>
 <p>C++ is a powerful general-purpose programming language that was developed as an extension of the C programming language by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s. C++ is widely used for system/software development, game development, and applications that require high performance.</p>

<h3>Features Of C++</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Object-Oriented: C++ supports object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, allowing for the creation of classes and objects. This helps in organizing code and promoting reusability</li>
            <li>Rich Standard Library: C++ provides a rich set of built-in functions and libraries, which can significantly reduce the development time.</li>
            <li>Performance: C++ offers low-level memory manipulation, allowing developers to optimize performance-critical applications</li>
            <li>Portability: C++ programs can be compiled and run on various platforms without significant modifications.</li>
            <li>Compatibility with C: C++ is compatible with C, allowing for the integration of existing C code.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Basic Syntax</h2>
<pre style="background-color: blanchedalmond;">
    <code>
          #include &lt;iostream&gt; 

            using namespace std;
             
            int main() {
                cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, World!" &lt;&lt; endl;
                return 0;
            }
    </code>
</pre>
<ul>
            <li>#include &lt;iostream&gt; This includes the input/output stream library, allowing the use of cout for output and cin for input.</li>
            <li>using namespace std;: This line allows access to the standard library features without prefixing them with std:</li>
            <li>int main(): The entry point of every C++ program</li>
            <li>cout: Used for outputting data to the console</li>
            <li>return 0;: Indicates that the program has ended successfully</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Applications of C++</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>System Software: C++ is used in developing operating systems and system-level applications.</li>
            <li>Game Development: Many game engines and games are written in C++ due to its performance and control over system resources.</li>
            <li>Embedded Systems: C++ is often used in programming embedded systems for devices like smartphones, appliances, and automotive systems.</li>
            <li>Web Browsers: Many web browsers, like Google Chrome, use C++ for performance-critical components</li>
        </ol>

   <h2>Introduction To Array</h2>
   <h3>What is an array?</h3>
   <img src="./array.png" alt="array image" height="250" width="460">
   <p>An array is a data structure that stores collection of elements, typically of the same data type.Array are used to store multiple value in a single variable , which allows for efficient data managment and manipulation.</p>
   <h3>Characterstics Of Array</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Fixed size : The size of an array is defined when it is created and cannot be changed.</li>
    <li>Indexed : Each element in array is accessed using an index , which typically starts from zero.</li>
    <li>Homogenous Element : all element in a array must be of same data type such as integers , floats and strings.</li>
   </ul>
   
   <h3>Types Of Array</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>One Dimensional Array : A linear list of element , where each element can be accesed by a single index .
        <ul>
            <li>Example : int number[5];(stores 5 integers)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Multi-Dimensional Array : Array with more than one dimension , commonly used for matrix and tables.
        <ul>
            <li>Example : int matrix [3][3];( a 3x3 matrix of integers)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Dynamic Array:Array that can change size during program execution , typically implanted using data structure using lists.
    </li>
   </ol>

 <section id="fourth">
 <h3>Introduction To Trees</h3>
 <p>A tree is a hierachical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. each tree has a single root node at the top , from which all other nodes branch out.Nodes can have zero or more child nodes, and each child node can further branch out into more nodes. Trees are commonly used to represent hierachichal relationship, such as file system or organizational structures.</p>
<img src="./tree.png" alt="data structure tree image" width="800" height="300">
<h3>Characterstics Of Trees </h3>
<ul>
    <li>Root Node : The topmost node in a tree, which has no parent.</li>
    <li>Child Node : A node that is a descendant of another node.</li>
    <li>Parent Node : A node that has one or more child nodes.</li>
    <li>Leaf Node : A node that has no children</li>
    <li>Depth : The number of edges from the root node to an specific node .</li>
    <li> Height : The number of edges on the longest path from a node to a leaf.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Types of trees</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Binary Tree: Each node has at most two children, referred to as the left and right children.</li>
    <li>Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree where the left child contains only nodes with values less than the parent node, and the right child contains only nodes with values greater than parent node.</li>
    <li>AVL Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree where the difference in heights between the left and right subtrees is at most one.</li>
    <li>Red-Black Tree: A balanced binary search tree with an additional property that ensures the tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions.</li>
    <li>N-ary Tree: A tree in which a node can have at most N children.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Applications For Trees</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Data Storage: Trees are used in databases for indexing data and improving search performances.</li>
    <li>File Systems: Hierarchical file systems use tree structures to organize files and directories.</li>
    <li>
Network Routing: Trees are used in routing algorithms to manage and optimize the flow of data across networks.</li>
    <li>Artificial Intelligence: Trees, such as decision trees, are used in AI algorithms for decision-making processes.
</li>
</ul>

 <section id="fifth">
 <h3>Introduction To Graphs</h3>
 <p>A graph is a data structure that consists of a set of vertices (or nodes) and a set of edges that connect pairs of vertices. Graphs are used to represent relationships or connections between various entities and are fundamental in computer science for modeling complex networks, such as social networks, transportation systems, and communication networks.
</p>
<img src="./graph.webp" alt="graph picture" height="300" width="800">
 <h3>Characterstics Of Graphs</h3>
 <ul>
    <li>Vertices (Nodes): The fundamental units of a graph, representing entities in the graph.</li>
    <li>Edges: Connections between pairs of vertices, which can be directed (one-way) or undirected (two-way).</li>
    <li>Degree: The number of edges connected to a vertex. For directed graphs, a vertex can have an in-degree (number of incoming edges) and an out-degree (number of outgoing edges).</li>
    <li>Path: A sequence of edges that connects a sequence of vertices.</li>
    <li>Cycle: A path that starts and ends at the same vertex without repeating any edges.</li>
 </ul>
<h3>Applications Of Graphs</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Social Networks: Graphs are used to model relationships and interactions between individuals or entities in social media platforms.</li>
    <li>Transportation Networks: Graphs represent roads, intersections, and routes in transportation systems, helping optimize travel and logistics.</li>
    <li>Web Page Link Analysis: The structure of the web can be represented as a graph, with web pages as vertices and hyperlinks as edges, enabling search engines to analyze and rank pages.</li>
    <li>Network Flow: Graphs are utilized in flow networks to model the flow of resources, such as electricity or data, through a network.</li>
